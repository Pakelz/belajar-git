- Git Started

    1. Using Git with Command Line
        git --version (To check git version and git alrd installed)
    
    2. Configure Git
        git config --global user.name "type name here"
        git config --global user.email "type email here"

        Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
        If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global

    3. Creating Git Folder
        mkdir belajar-git (makes a new directory)
        cd belajar-git  (changes the current working directory)

        Note: If you already have a folder/directory you would like to use for Git:
        Navigate to it in command line, or open it in your file explorer, right-click and select "Git Bash here"

    4. Initialize Git
        git init

- Git Staging Environment 

    1. Git add New file
        git add index.html (add new file and staged)
        git status (to check file added to the staging environment)

    2. Git add more than one file
        git add --all (add all file )
        git status

- Git Commit 

    1. Git Commit
        git commit -m "First release of Hello World!" (The commit command performs a commit, and the -m "message" adds a message.)

    2. Git Commit without stage
        git status --short
        git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"

        Warning: Skipping the Staging Environment is not generally recommended.
        Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes.
    
    3. Git Commit Log
        git log (To view the history of commits for a repository)

- Git Help 

    1. Git Help
        git command -help (See all the available options for the specific command)
        git help --all (See all possible commands)
